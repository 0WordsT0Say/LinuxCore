<summary><b>More Information About LinuxCore</b></summary> <br />
  
LinuxCore was orginally gonna be named LinxCore. Until we found out a company product goes by LinX Core. So we changed to have LinuxCore with the U instead. <br />
  
LinuxCore was first thought of 10/24/2023 and execution to be making LinuxCore soon followed after. The thought of LinuxCore was accidental while making wallpapers. It was gonna be a wallpaper with the andromeda galaxy and the word core in the bottom left corner. But soon after it felt as if something was missing I looked at the filename LinxCore and thats what I added was Linx, and just then I wanted to make my very own Linux Distro. Of course it is now LinuxCore. <br />
